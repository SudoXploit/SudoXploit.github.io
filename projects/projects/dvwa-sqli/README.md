# üîê DVWA SQL Injection ‚Äì Login Bypass (Web App Pentest Lab)

A hands-on security lab showcasing **SQL Injection authentication bypass** against [DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) running on a local XAMPP stack. This project demonstrates how classic SQLi techniques can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access to a web app's admin panel, complete with Burp Suite interception and payload crafting.

> ‚úÖ Designed for educational and ethical testing purposes only.

## üìå Project Overview

This lab simulates a real-world web application vulnerability using DVWA's *Low Security* configuration. The objective is to:

- Perform authentication bypass using SQL Injection payloads
- Understand the underlying SQL logic being exploited
- Practice with Burp Suite, MySQL, and XAMPP in a controlled environment

It‚Äôs part of a broader pentesting portfolio exploring various attack vectors in lab environments.
