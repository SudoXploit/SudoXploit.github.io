## üî• About Me  

**Name:** Motiranjan Barik  
**Username:** SudoXploit  
**Title:** Cybersecurity Professional | Ethical Hacker | Red Teamer | Network Security Specialist  
**Location:** India  

I‚Äôm not your average IT guy. I‚Äôm the one called in when systems are compromised, when infrastructures need to be stress-tested, and when blind spots need to be exposed before attackers find them.  

A relentless **Red Team Operator** and **Network Security Specialist**, I specialize in turning vulnerabilities into opportunities for strengthening digital fortresses.
